**#Assignment-1**
Create lower triangular, upper triangular and pyramid containing the "*" character.

This project involves developing a program that generates and displays three specific types of patterns using the "*" character: lower triangular, upper triangular, and pyramid. These patterns are widely used in programming exercises to practice nested loops and control structures. The goal of the project is to create a user-friendly tool that allows users to input the desired size of the pattern and then display the corresponding pattern on the screen.


**#Assignment-2**
Create a simple calculator which can perform simple arithmetic operations like add, subtract, division, multiplication etc.

This project involves developing a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator will take input from the user, process the arithmetic operation, and display the result. The goal of this project is to create an intuitive and user-friendly tool that can handle basic calculations efficiently.


**#Assignment-3**
Take Any dataset of your choice and do the visualization

The dataset which i have choosed is heart.csv.

Data Visualization: The box plot and histogram parts of your code are directly related to data visualization. They help in understanding the distribution, spread, and potential outliers in the data.

**#Assignment-4**
Data Preprocessing and feature engineering

Data Preprocessing: This involves cleaning and transforming raw data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis, including handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: This is the process of creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models, often by incorporating domain knowledge and transforming data into formats better suited for predictive algorithms.

**#Assignment-5**
Perform data preprocessing on a dataset (e.g., Titanic dataset) including cleaning, handling missing values, transformation, normalization, encoding, and feature engineering for predictive modeling.
